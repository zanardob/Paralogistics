This folder contains all the models used on the "New Scheduling" section of the application.
Due to a limitation on the JavaFX API, you can't show objects from different classes on a TableView.
For this reason, some queries that return data from more than 1 table couldn't be showed with the simple models (found on the "viewtables" folder).
We then created some classes that effectively "merge" elements from 2 or more tables here.
